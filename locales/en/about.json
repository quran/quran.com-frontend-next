  "description": "The Noble Quran is the central religious text of Islam. Muslims believe the Qurâ€™an is the book of Divine guidance and direction for mankind, and consider the original Arabic text the final revelation of Allah (God).[1] All translations of the original Arabic text are thus interpretations of the original meanings and should be embraced as such. For more information about the Noble Quran, you may visit its Wikipedia article."
