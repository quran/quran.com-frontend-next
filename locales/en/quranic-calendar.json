We encourage you to take time to understand and reflect on the verses so you can gain a deeper, more heartfelt connection.",
    "line-2": "You can make this calendar your personal reading schedule or invite your friends, family, halaqa group, masjid community, or organization to follow along. As more people around the world follow the same schedule, we can all benefit from sharing reflections, having discussions, and learning about the same verses at the same time. Join any time, and if you miss a week, simply continue your reading for the following week without pressure!"
