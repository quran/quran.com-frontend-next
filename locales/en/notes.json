This is referred to as \"Tadabbur\". Tafsir,  in contrast, is a scholarly interpretation of the Quran, providing detailed explanations of its verses based on classical sources and scholarly analysis. While Tafsir is reserved for the scholars, Allah ﷻ asks everyone to engage in Tadabbur (Quran <link1>38:29</link1>, <link2>47:24</link2>, <link3>4:82</link3>, and many more).<br></br><br></br>Users can save their notes and personal reflections privately. Oftentimes our reflections can deeply resonate with others, aiding their connection to the Quran, and their relationship with Allah ﷻ. That’s why users have the option to share their reflection to QuranReflect as part of our efforts to help people grow together in their journey.
