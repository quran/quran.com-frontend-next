# Task T6: Reset Settings Action

## Objective
Implement a "Reset to defaults" feature that allows users to revert their settings to the initial, localized defaults.

## Context
This feature provides an easy way for users to undo any customizations and return to the application's recommended settings for their detected locale. This involves adding a new UI element and the corresponding Redux logic to handle the reset process.

## Files to Modify
- `src/components/Navbar/SettingsDrawer/index.tsx` (or the main settings view)
- `src/redux/slices/defaultSettings.ts`

## Acceptance Criteria
- A "Reset to defaults" button is added to the main settings drawer.
- Clicking the button dispatches a new Redux thunk named `resetDefaultSettings`.
- The `resetDefaultSettings` thunk performs the following actions:
  - Re-runs the initial locale detection using `detectUserLanguageAndCountry()`.
  - Fetches the corresponding default settings using `getCountryLanguagePreference()`.
  - Dispatches `setDefaultsFromCountryPreference` to update the Redux state with the fetched settings.
  - Resets the `userHasCustomised` flag to `false`.
