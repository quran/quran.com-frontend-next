# Task T2: Extend Default Settings Slice & Customisation Flag

## Objective
Enhance the existing `defaultSettingsSlice` (`src/redux/slices/defaultSettings.ts`) to manage localization settings and track user customizations.

## Context
To support intelligent default settings, the Redux state needs to store the detected locale and a flag indicating whether the user has manually changed their preferences. This will allow the application to decide whether to apply default settings or preserve the user's choices when the language is changed.

## Files to Modify
- `src/redux/slices/defaultSettings.ts`
- `src/redux/RootState.ts` (to include the new state properties)

## Acceptance Criteria
- The `defaultSettings` slice state is extended to include:
  - `detectedCountry: string`
  - `detectedLanguage: string`
  - `userHasCustomised: boolean`
- A new thunk `setDefaultsFromCountryPreference(pref)` is created to update the settings in the slice based on the fetched country preference. This thunk should dispatch other actions like `setTranslations`, `setSelectedTafsir`, etc.
- A new action `setUserHasCustomised(hasCustomised: boolean)` is created.
- All existing reducers that modify user preferences (e.g., for translation, reciter, tafsir selection) are updated to dispatch `setUserHasCustomised(true)`.
