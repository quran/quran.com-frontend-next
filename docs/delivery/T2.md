# Task T2: Extend Default Settings Slice & Customisation Flag

## Objective

Enhance the existing `defaultSettingsSlice` (`src/redux/slices/defaultSettings.ts`) to manage
localization settings and track user customizations.

## Context

To support intelligent default settings, the Redux state needs to store the detected locale and a
flag indicating whether the user has manually changed their preferences. This will allow the
application to decide whether to apply default settings or preserve the user's choices when the
language is changed.

## Files to Modify

- `src/redux/slices/defaultSettings.ts`
- `src/redux/RootState.ts` (to include the new state properties)

## Acceptance Criteria

- The `defaultSettings` slice state is extended to include:
  - `detectedCountry: string`
  - `detectedLanguage: string`
  - `userHasCustomised: boolean`
- A new thunk `setDefaultsFromCountryPreference(pref)` is created to update the settings in the
  slice based on the fetched country preference. This thunk should dispatch other actions like
  `setTranslations`, `setSelectedTafsir`, etc.
- A new action `setUserHasCustomised(hasCustomised: boolean)` is created.
- All existing reducers that modify user preferences (e.g., for translation, reciter, tafsir
  selection) are updated to dispatch `setUserHasCustomised(true)`.
