# Task T7: Reflections Query Update

## Objective
Modify the reflections fetching logic to use the dynamic list of reflection languages from the Redux state.

## Context
The list of languages for reflections should match the `reflectionLangs[]` array specified in the user's active settings preset. This ensures that the reflections shown to the user are always relevant to their current language and localization preferences.

## Files to Modify
- `src/utils/quranReflect/locale.ts`

## Acceptance Criteria
- The `getReflections` function (or equivalent) in `src/utils/quranReflect/locale.ts` is updated.
- The function now retrieves the `reflectionLanguages` array from the Redux store.
- This array is used to construct the API call for fetching reflections, replacing any hardcoded locale or heuristic.
- The reflections displayed to the user match the languages defined in their settings.
