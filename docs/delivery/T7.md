# Task T7: Reflections Query Update

## Objective

Modify the reflections fetching logic to use the dynamic list of reflection languages from the Redux
state.

## Context

The list of languages for reflections should match the `reflectionLangs[]` array specified in the
user's active settings preset. This ensures that the reflections shown to the user are always
relevant to their current language and localization preferences.

## Files to Modify

- `src/utils/quranReflect/locale.ts`

## Acceptance Criteria

- The `getReflections` function (or equivalent) in `src/utils/quranReflect/locale.ts` is updated.
- The function now retrieves the `reflectionLanguages` array from the Redux store.
- This array is used to construct the API call for fetching reflections, replacing any hardcoded
  locale or heuristic.
- The reflections displayed to the user match the languages defined in their settings.
