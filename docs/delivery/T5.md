# Task T5: Language Selector Logic

## Objective

Enhance the language selector component to intelligently apply default settings based on user
interaction.

## Context

When a user changes the site language, the system should respect their custom preferences if they
have been set. Otherwise, it should apply a new set of default settings corresponding to the newly
selected language.

## Files to Modify

- `src/components/Navbar/SettingsDrawer/LanguageSelector.tsx`
- The component that handles the language change logic.

## Acceptance Criteria

- When a user selects a new language from the language selector:
  - The `userHasCustomised` flag is checked from the Redux store.
  - If `userHasCustomised` is **true**, only the application locale is changed, and the user's other
    settings remain untouched.
  - If `userHasCustomised` is **false**, the `getCountryLanguagePreference(newLanguage, country)`
    API is called, and the `setDefaultsFromCountryPreference` thunk is dispatched to apply the new
    default settings.
- The `userHasCustomised` flag in Redux is not changed by this action.
