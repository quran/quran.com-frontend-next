# Task T1: Locale Detection Service

## Objective
Integrate `detectUserLanguageAndCountry()` from `src/utils/serverSideLanguageDetection.ts` to fetch the `{ countryCode, languageCode }` on the server-side for every page.

## Context
The goal is to determine the user's country and language on the server to provide localized content from the very first request. The `CF-IPCountry` header (from Cloudflare) will provide the country, and the `Accept-Language` header will provide the language. This logic should be implemented within the `getServerSideProps` function of each page, leveraging the `withSsrRedux` wrapper to make the detected locale available to the Redux store.

## Files to Modify
- All page components under `src/pages/` that use `getServerSideProps`.
- `src/utils/serverSideLanguageDetection.ts` (if any modifications are needed).

## Acceptance Criteria
- `detectUserLanguageAndCountry()` is called within the `getServerSideProps` function on pages that require server-side rendering.
- The detected `countryCode` and `languageCode` are dispatched to the Redux store.
- The implementation should be done in a way that it can be easily applied across all server-rendered pages.
