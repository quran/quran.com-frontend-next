# Task T4: Auth Integration

## Objective
Integrate the default settings logic with the authentication flow, ensuring that settings are persisted for registered users.

## Context
User settings should be saved to the database upon sign-up and retrieved upon login. This ensures a consistent experience across devices. If a logged-in user has no saved settings, they should receive the same default settings as a new guest.

## Files to Modify
- `src/hooks/auth/useOnboarding.ts` (or equivalent sign-up logic)
- `src/utils/auth/api.ts` (or equivalent login/session logic)
- `src/redux/slices/auth.ts`

## Acceptance Criteria
- On **sign-up**, the current settings from the Redux store are passed to the `persistDefaultSettings` API call.
- On **login**, when the user's settings are hydrated from the backend, if no settings are found, the application triggers the same locale detection and default settings flow as it would for a new guest.
- The `userHasCustomised` flag should be persisted and retrieved along with other settings.
