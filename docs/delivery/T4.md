# Task T4: Auth Integration

## Objective

Integrate the default settings logic with the authentication flow, ensuring that settings are
persisted for registered users.

## Context

User settings should be saved to the database upon sign-up and retrieved upon login. This ensures a
consistent experience across devices. If a logged-in user has no saved settings, they should receive
the same default settings as a new guest.

## Files to Modify

- `src/hooks/auth/useOnboarding.ts` (or equivalent sign-up logic)
- `src/utils/auth/api.ts` (or equivalent login/session logic)
- `src/redux/slices/auth.ts`

## Acceptance Criteria

- On **sign-up**, the current settings from the Redux store are passed to the
  `persistDefaultSettings` API call.
- On **login**, when the user's settings are hydrated from the backend, if no settings are found,
  the application triggers the same locale detection and default settings flow as it would for a new
  guest.
- The `userHasCustomised` flag should be persisted and retrieved along with other settings.
