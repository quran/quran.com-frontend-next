This project is the frontend for Quran.com. It is built on top of [next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started), a popular framework that takes the trouble and setup of setting up an isomorphic react app. We deploy it on now.sh automatically with automatic generation of builds for PRs.

### How to contribute

We trust that you will not copy this idea/project, this is at the end for the sake of Allah and we all have good intentions while working with this project. But we must stress that copying the code/project is unacceptable.

### Running the app locally

- Ensure you have the latest `nodejs` and `npm` installed. Prefer 10+.
- Ensure you have `yarn` installed. Simply `npm i -g yarn`
- Clone this repo
- Run `yarn` on the repo to install `node_modules`
- Run `yarn dev` to start the app. If you wish to run on a different port, run `yarn dev -p 8000`
- Open `localhost:3000`

The app runs on next.js and will automatically hot reload when you make changes.

### Environment variables

If you have access to a Quran.com associated vercel account, run `vercel env pull`. Otherwise, rename the `env.example` file to  `env.local` and you should be good to go. 

### DLS (design language system)

One mistake we made previously is treated each component as unique. This made our work not scalable. Secondly, when looking at large companies, they often develop a design style language that can be used across the app without the need to create unique components and ensure better consistency across the product. We are trying to take a similar approach. If something can be used elsewhere, please put it inside the `dls/` directory and create stories for it.

### Storybook.js

Our components are built within Storybook.js. See files with name `.stories.tsx`. This helps engineers view their work outside of the product, making it super easy to test different configurations of the component.

[We also display all our components here](https://quran.github.io/quran.com-frontend-next/storybook/master).

### Recommended Extensions

Check `.vscode/extensions.json` for recommended VSCode Extensions
### Typescript

We chose typescript as the language of choice of it's ease of type-safety. Please create types where you see fit.

### Helping out and issues

If you are interested to help out, please look at issues on the Github repo. This is a good place to start.

### Filing bugs

Thank you for taking time to file a bug! We'd appreciate your help on fixing it üôè. Please [open an issue](https://github.com/quran/quran.com-frontend-next/issues).
