    To whom it may concern,

    I am the owner and administrator of the quran.com domain and co-founder of the same project. I hereby give authorization to Amrit Siddiqui to act on behalf of quran.com for our Twitter account. As our social media manager, she will be using the email address social@quran.com in association with the Twitter account and in future correspondence. She will attach a photo of her drivers license in response to this request.

    We would like to use the username @Qurancom on Twitter, which currently appears to be a completely in-active account. We greatly appreciate any help you can provide. We would also like to have this account verified and would appreciate help in this regard as well. Please let us know if there is anything else you need from us. Thank you for your help.

    Sincerely, 
    Nour Sharabash
    Quran.com Co-Founder
