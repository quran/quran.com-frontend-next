          <h2>10. Quran.com DISCLOSURES</h2>
          <p>
            10.1 When it comes to buying products or services when using the internet, it is
            recommended that you always conduct your own investigations. This includes buying any
            products or services offered or sold as part of, or through, the Service.
          </p>
          <p>
            10.2 Unless we have stated otherwise, you should always assume that when products or
            services are made reference to on the Service, they are made because there exists a
            material connection between Quran.com and the providers of the products and services
            displayed. It should be noted that this is not always the case.
          </p>
          <p>
            10.3 Quran.com will always recommend products and services based in part on a good faith
            belief that the supply of such products or services will help you. We have a good faith
            belief, because Quran.com has either tried the products or services prior to making any
            recommendations, or we have researched the products or services based on the supplierâ€™s
            history. The recommendations made by Quran.com about the products or services are honest
            opinions based on facts known to us at the time a product or service is mentioned on the
            Service.
          </p>
          <p>
            10.4 We have conducted all steps possible to verify the testimonials that appear on the
            Service on behalf of Quran.com. They are treated as average user expectations based on
            the information that was available at the time of publishing them. They are not
            exaggerations of user results which we do not entertain in any form. Enquiries have been
            made to confirm their authenticity at all times. If a claim sounds untrue then We regard
            this as such and do not publish this on the Service.
          </p>
          <p>
            10.5 Where extracts have been displayed from third party sources or content has been
            generated and posted by a third party source, these are in no way indicative of any kind
            of verifiable result, opinion, recommendation or otherwise. You are strongly cautioned
            to conduct your own due diligence prior to relying on such sources.
          </p>
          <p>
            10.6 Our aim is to be 100% honest at all times. If, however, you find something
            displayed on the Service, which you do not agree with, then please contact us
            immediately at info@quran.foundation and we will look into it. We reserve the right to
            withdraw the display of any product or service that does not reach our very high levels
            of satisfaction without any prior notice. Honesty and integrity are important to us at
            all times.
